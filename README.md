# Material Theme Util

This library is a interface for Angular Material UI Library and custom colors. The intended purpose it serves is to provide a dynamic solution for changing Angular Material theme colors on the fly _and_ offer the ability to set the colors with any hex code.

This library _should_ seamlessly integrate with most Angular Material applications - requiring very little (if any) modification on the Material Side.
